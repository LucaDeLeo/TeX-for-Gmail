## [1.0.0-beta] - 2025-08-13

### üéâ Initial Beta Release

This is the first production-ready release of TeX for Gmail, featuring comprehensive bug fixes and stability improvements.

### ‚ú® Added
- **Real-time LaTeX rendering** with 500ms smart debouncing
- **Toggle control** button in Gmail compose toolbar
- **Smart send interceptor** - Automatically renders LaTeX when sending emails
- **Code block protection** - LaTeX in `<code>`, `<pre>`, and `<tt>` tags is not rendered
- **Currency detection** - Distinguishes mathematical expressions from currency amounts
- **Comprehensive memory management** with WeakMaps and removal observers
- **Race condition prevention** using mutex patterns
- **Advanced cursor preservation** with absolute offset calculation
- **Pattern normalization** for consistent equation rendering
- **Rate limiting** (60 API calls per minute)
- **XSS protection** with LaTeX validation
- **Toast notifications** for user feedback
- **Debug mode** for development troubleshooting

### üêõ Fixed

#### Critical Bug Fixes
1. **Cursor Deletion Bug** (Story 2.1)
   - **Issue**: Text deletion when cursor was inside LaTeX during rendering
   - **Solution**: Implemented absolute offset calculation system that survives DOM mutations
   - **Impact**: Prevents data loss during editing

2. **Memory Leaks** (Story 2.1)
   - **Issue**: Observers and timeouts accumulating without cleanup
   - **Solution**: Comprehensive cleanup with removal observers and WeakMap management
   - **Impact**: Stable performance during extended use

3. **Race Conditions** (Story 2.1)
   - **Issue**: Concurrent operations causing state corruption
   - **Solution**: Mutex patterns with `dataset.processing` flags
   - **Impact**: Reliable toggle operations even with rapid clicking

4. **Send Interceptor Infinite Recursion** (Story 2.1)
   - **Issue**: Send button click triggered interceptor recursively
   - **Solution**: `programmaticSendInProgress` flag prevents re-interception
   - **Impact**: Emails send correctly without hanging

5. **Observer Not Detecting Text Edits** (QA Fix)
   - **Issue**: MutationObserver missing characterData changes
   - **Solution**: Added `mutation.type === 'characterData'` detection
   - **Impact**: Real-time rendering now works when typing

6. **Inconsistent Rendering** (Ultra-think Fix)
   - **Issue**: Some equations not rendering after toggle operations
   - **Solution**: Added `normalize()` call to merge adjacent text nodes
   - **Impact**: All equations render consistently

7. **Code Block Rendering** (Security Fix)
   - **Issue**: LaTeX in code examples was being rendered
   - **Solution**: Added CODE/PRE/TT element filtering in TreeWalker
   - **Impact**: Code examples remain as text

#### Additional Fixes
- Fixed async image loading in send interceptor
- Fixed keyboard shortcut support (Ctrl/Cmd+Enter)
- Fixed compose area detection relative to send button
- Fixed error recovery with proper cleanup
- Fixed button state visual feedback
- Fixed processing flag cleanup in finally blocks
- Fixed TreeWalker node filtering logic
- Fixed toggle button visual state (ON/OFF labels)

### üîÑ Changed
- Updated manifest to version 3 compliance
- Improved error messages and logging
- Enhanced DOM traversal with TreeWalker
- Optimized pattern matching with single-pass processing
- Refined currency detection patterns
- Improved button styling and animations

### üîí Security
- LaTeX validation against XSS attacks
- Content Security Policy compliance
- URL encoding for API requests
- Rate limiting protection
- No storage of user data

### üìù Documentation
- Added comprehensive README with privacy notice
- Created CONCERNS_AND_ROADMAP.md for future development
- Added inline code documentation
- Created test harnesses for debugging

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues
1. **Privacy Concern** - All LaTeX sent to external CodeCogs API
2. **Dark Mode** - White background images clash with Gmail dark theme
3. **Offline Support** - No functionality without internet
4. **Copy/Paste** - Cannot copy LaTeX source from rendered equations
5. **Performance at Scale** - Untested with 100+ equations
