# Introduction
This document supplements the current extensionâ€™s architecture by defining how new components will integrate with existing systems. Where conflicts arise between new and existing patterns, this document provides guidance on maintaining consistency while implementing enhancements.

- Source PRD: Using sharded PRD under `docs/prd/` (confirm or provide brownfield PRD).
- Enhancement: Complete outstanding PRD v3.0 compliance items documented in `test-report-prd-compliance.md` (rendering reliability, display math correctness, fallback behavior, DPI alignment, delimiter/currency handling, storage robustness).
- Activation scope: Significant enhancements impacting rendering, error handling, options/storage defaults, and manual test harness coverage.
