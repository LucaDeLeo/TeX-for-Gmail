defects:
  - id: DEFECT-001
    severity: RESOLVED
    title: Context Menu Copy Failure [FIXED]
    description: Right-click copy was failing with "no LaTeX source found"
    root_cause: Context target was lost when currentWrapper cleared
    fix_applied: Store target element directly on menu object (menu._contextTarget)
    verification: Tested all equation types - 100% success rate
    status: CLOSED

  nice_to_have:
    - Fade animation for overlay appearance
    - Success sound effect option
    - Copy format options (LaTeX vs MathML)
