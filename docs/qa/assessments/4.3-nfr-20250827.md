Date: 2025-08-27
Reviewer: Quinn

## Summary

- Security: PASS — Keyboard handlers scoped to compose/read areas, no privileged APIs used; no data collection.
- Performance: PASS — Template insertion and click-to-edit are constant-time operations; acceptable responsiveness verified up to ~100 rendered images.
- Reliability: PASS — Event listeners registered/removed predictably; works across compose/reply/forward; no observed race in test harness.
- Maintainability: PASS — Clear separation of concerns (handlers/utilities/options); settings persisted via Chrome storage with immediate effect.

## Critical Issues

None identified for this story. See cross-cutting items in reports for DPI defaults and server fallback covered under earlier stories.
