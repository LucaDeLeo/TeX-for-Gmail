# Story 1.2: LaTeX Detection and CodeCogs Rendering Pipeline

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** Gmail user writing mathematical equations,
**I want** my LaTeX notation between $ delimiters to be automatically detected and rendered as images,
**so that** I can see visual representations of my mathematical expressions while composing emails

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Detect inline math patterns between single dollar signs ($...$)
2. Detect display math patterns between double dollar signs ($$...$$)
3. Real-time detection with 500ms debounce after user stops typing
4. Replace detected LaTeX with PNG images from CodeCogs API
5. Images wrapped in green background (#d4f8d4) with padding and border radius
6. Original LaTeX stored in data attributes for later restoration
7. Preserve cursor position during rendering
8. Handle invalid LaTeX gracefully (keep original text if API fails)
9. Don't re-render already processed math elements
10. Maintain different sizes for inline (110 DPI) vs display (150 DPI) math

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.1 implementation [Source: docs/stories/1.1.story.md]:
- Extension successfully injecting into Gmail with content.js
- TeX button added to compose toolbar with click handler
- Compose area detected using selector '[g_editable="true"]'
- MutationObserver pattern established for dynamic DOM monitoring
- Debouncing pattern implemented (100ms for observer)
- State management using WeakMaps for tracking processed elements
- Toast notification system implemented for user feedback
- IIFE pattern with TeXForGmail namespace for encapsulation

### Technical Context from PRD

**LaTeX Detection Patterns** [Source: prd.md#core-functionality]:
- Inline Math: Patterns between `$...$`
- Display Math: Patterns between `$$...$$`
- No line breaks allowed within delimiters
- Real-time processing with 500ms debounce

**CodeCogs API Configuration** [Source: prd.md#api-integration]:
```javascript
function getCodeCogsUrl(latex, isDisplay) {
  const encoded = encodeURIComponent(latex);
  const dpi = isDisplay ? '150' : '110';
  const size = isDisplay ? '\\large' : '\\normalsize';
  return `https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?\\dpi{${dpi}}${size}%20${encoded}`;
}
```

**Visual Rendering Requirements** [Source: prd.md#user-interface]:
```html
<!-- Inline math -->
<span class="tex-math-inline" style="background-color:#d4f8d4; padding:2px 4px; border-radius:3px; display:inline-block;">
  <img src="[codecogs_url]" alt="$latex_source$" style="vertical-align:middle;">
</span>

<!-- Display math -->
<span class="tex-math-display" style="background-color:#d4f8d4; padding:4px 8px; border-radius:3px; display:inline-block; margin:4px 0;">
  <img src="[codecogs_url]" alt="$$latex_source$$" style="vertical-align:middle;">
</span>
```

**Rendering Pipeline** [Source: prd.md#technical-implementation]:
1. Detect LaTeX patterns in text nodes
2. Extract LaTeX code
3. Generate CodeCogs URL
4. Create img element with green wrapper
5. Replace text with rendered element
6. Store original LaTeX in data attribute for toggle

**Edge Cases to Handle** [Source: prd.md#behavioral-specifications]:
- Currency: Don't render "$5 and $10" as math
- Broken LaTeX: Show original text if API fails
- Nested Elements: Handle Gmail's complex DOM structure
- Smart re-rendering: Don't re-render already processed math

**Performance Requirements** [Source: prd.md#performance-requirements]:
- Debounce: 500ms delay before processing
- Batch Processing: Render multiple formulas in single pass
- DOM Updates: Use DocumentFragment for batch DOM updates
- Memory: Clean up event listeners properly

### File Locations
Based on Story 1.1 structure:
- `/Users/luca/dev/TeX-for-Gmail/content.js` - **EXISTS** from Story 1.1, will be modified to add rendering logic
- `/Users/luca/dev/TeX-for-Gmail/styles.css` - **NEW FILE** to be created for math element styling
- `/Users/luca/dev/TeX-for-Gmail/manifest.json` - **EXISTS** from Story 1.1, update to include styles.css

### Technical Constraints
- No external libraries - vanilla JavaScript only
- Must maintain Manifest V3 compliance
- CodeCogs API is the only rendering service to use
- Images must include alt text with original LaTeX
- Green background (#d4f8d4) is signature visual element

### Rollback Procedure
If rendering issues arise after deployment:
1. In content.js, comment out the new rendering functions:
   - Comment out `detectAndRenderLatex()` function
   - Comment out `renderLatexElement()` function
   - Comment out the debounced render call in button click handler
2. Keep the TeX button visible but non-functional (shows "Rendering disabled")
3. This preserves Story 1.1 functionality while disabling Story 1.2 features

## Testing

### Testing Standards
No formal testing framework established yet. Manual testing required for all functionality.

### Manual Testing Checklist
1. Test inline math: Type `$x^2 + y^2 = z^2$` and verify rendering
2. Test display math: Type `$$\int_0^1 f(x)dx$$` and verify larger rendering
3. Test debouncing: Type continuously and verify 500ms delay
4. Test cursor position: Place cursor mid-formula, verify position maintained
5. Test invalid LaTeX: Type `$\invalid{$` and verify original text remains
6. Test currency: Type "$5 and $10" and verify no rendering
7. Test re-rendering: Click TeX button multiple times, verify no duplicates
8. Test green background: Verify #d4f8d4 background on all rendered math
9. Test alt text: Inspect rendered images for original LaTeX in alt attribute

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-06

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

The implementation successfully meets all acceptance criteria with functional LaTeX rendering via CodeCogs API. However, I identified and fixed several **critical performance and security issues** that would have caused production problems:

1. **Memory Leak (Critical)**: New MutationObserver created on every button click without cleanup
2. **Security Vulnerability**: No LaTeX input validation before API calls
3. **Performance Issues**: Regex patterns recreated on every render, unused document fragment
4. **Poor Resource Management**: No rate limiting for API calls, no proper observer lifecycle management

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: content.js
  - **Change**: Fixed memory leak by implementing proper observer lifecycle management
  - **Why**: Previous implementation created new MutationObservers on every button click without cleanup, causing memory leaks
  - **How**: Created `setupAutoRenderObserver()` and `cleanupComposeObserver()` functions with WeakMap tracking per compose area

- **File**: content.js
  - **Change**: Added LaTeX validation and rate limiting
  - **Why**: Prevent injection attacks and API abuse
  - **How**: Implemented `isValidLatex()` function to check for dangerous patterns and added rate limiting (60 calls/minute)

- **File**: content.js
  - **Change**: Replaced all console.log with centralized logging
  - **Why**: Better control over debug output and production logging
  - **How**: Added `TeXForGmail.log()` method with debug mode toggle

- **File**: content.js
  - **Change**: Enhanced currency detection patterns
  - **Why**: Original patterns missed common cases like "$5/hour" or "USD $100"
  - **How**: Added additional regex patterns for various currency formats

- **File**: content.js
  - **Change**: Fixed render timeout management
  - **Why**: Global timeout variable caused conflicts between multiple compose windows
  - **How**: Implemented per-compose-area timeout tracking using WeakMaps

- **File**: styles.css
  - **Change**: Added accessibility and performance enhancements
  - **Why**: Improve user experience for users with disabilities and optimize rendering
  - **How**: Added high contrast mode support, reduced motion preferences, and will-change optimization

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Code follows clean architecture principles with proper encapsulation
- Project Structure: ✓ Files properly organized as per story requirements
