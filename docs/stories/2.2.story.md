# Story 2.2: Self-Documenting LaTeX Images with Attribute-Based Source Storage

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** Gmail user using the TeX for Gmail extension,
**I want** LaTeX source to be stored directly in image attributes with multiple fallbacks,
**so that** the source is never lost and can be reliably restored even after page reloads, copy/paste, or extension failures

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Rendered LaTeX images include all self-documenting attributes (alt, title, data-latex, data-display, data-timestamp, data-version, class, contenteditable, style)
2. Source extraction function successfully retrieves LaTeX from multiple fallback locations in priority order
3. Toggle OFF operation correctly restores LaTeX source from image attributes instead of WeakMap snapshots
4. Existing rendering and toggle functionality remains fully operational
5. LaTeX source survives Gmail auto-save and page reload
6. Copy/paste of rendered equations preserves source via alt text
7. All existing tests pass and new attribute-based restoration works correctly
8. Performance remains consistent (render operations <100ms excluding network latency)

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Task 1: Enhance createMathWrapper with Self-Documenting Attributes (AC: 1, 5, 6)
  - [x] Add alt attribute with full LaTeX source including delimiters
  - [x] Add title attribute with "LaTeX: " prefix for user tooltips
  - [x] Add data-latex attribute with clean source (no delimiters)
  - [x] Add data-display attribute ("inline" or "block")
  - [x] Add data-timestamp attribute with render time
  - [x] Add data-version attribute with extension version ("1.0.0")
  - [x] Add contenteditable="false" to prevent cursor issues
  - [x] Update CSS class to "tex-rendered" for consistency
  - [x] Test all attributes are preserved after Gmail auto-save

- [x] Task 2: Implement Source Extraction Function (AC: 2, 3)
  - [x] Create extractSourceFromElement() function with priority fallbacks
  - [x] Priority 1: Check data-latex attribute and add appropriate delimiters

  - [x] Create test cases for progressive enhancement
  - [x] Verify all existing functionality remains intact

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context from NEW_APPROACH.md

**Core Philosophy**: "Render in place, source travels with image, edit on demand"
- Instead of maintaining dual states, maintain one state that carries its history
- Store LaTeX source in standard HTML attributes for maximum compatibility
- Use progressive enhancement with multiple fallbacks

### Technical Implementation Details

#### Self-Documenting Image Structure (NEW_APPROACH.md lines 19-35)
```javascript
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?..."
     alt="$x^2$"                      // Primary source - survives everything
     title="LaTeX: $x^2$"             // User tooltip - helpful hint
     data-latex="x^2"                 // Clean source for extension
     data-display="inline"            // Or "block" for $$..$$
     data-timestamp="1699934400000"  // Track when rendered
     data-version="1.0.0"             // Extension version
     class="tex-rendered"             // For CSS styling
     contenteditable="false"          // Prevent cursor issues
     style="vertical-align: middle; cursor: pointer;">
```

#### Source Preservation Priority (NEW_APPROACH.md lines 39-47)
| Priority | Storage Location | Survives | Notes |
|----------|-----------------|----------|--------|
| 1 | `alt` attribute | Everything | Standard HTML, email-safe |
| 2 | `data-latex` | Most cases | Clean version without delimiters |
| 3 | `title` attribute | Email clients | User-visible on hover |
| 4 | Local storage | Page reloads | Backup with timestamp |
| 5 | Original snapshot | Session | WeakMap fallback |

#### Restoration Logic Template (NEW_APPROACH.md lines 51-78)
```javascript
function extractSourceFromElement(element) {
  // Try multiple sources in order of preference
  if (element.dataset?.latex) {
    // Clean data attribute
    const display = element.dataset.display === 'block' ? '$$' : '$';
    return `${display}${element.dataset.latex}${display}`;
  }

  if (element.alt) {
    // Alt text (most reliable)
    return element.alt;
  }

  if (element.title?.startsWith('LaTeX: ')) {
    // Title attribute fallback
    return element.title.substring(7);
  }

  // Last resort - check localStorage
  const cached = localStorage.getItem(`tex_${element.src}`);
  if (cached) {
    return cached;
  }

  return '[LaTeX source lost]';  // Should never happen
}
```

### File Locations
Based on existing structure:
- `/Users/luca/dev/TeX-for-Gmail/content.js` - **MODIFY** to implement attribute enhancements
- No other files need modification for this story

### Technical Constraints
- Must maintain Manifest V3 compliance
- Vanilla JavaScript only - no external libraries
- Must preserve backward compatibility with Stories 1.1-2.1
- All changes must be in content.js only
- Must not break existing toggle, rendering, or send interceptor functionality
- Performance impact must be minimal

### Implementation Notes

#### Current createMathWrapper Function (content.js lines 264-285)
The existing function creates a span wrapper with basic attributes. This needs enhancement to:
1. Move to img-based approach with comprehensive attributes
2. Add all self-documenting attributes specified
3. Ensure backward compatibility

#### Current Restoration (content.js lines 483-546)
Currently uses WeakMap-based snapshot system. Need to:
1. Add extractSourceFromElement() function
2. Modify restoration to prioritize attribute extraction
3. Keep WeakMap as fallback for backward compatibility

#### Benefits Over Current Approach (NEW_APPROACH.md lines 233-242)
| Aspect | Current | New Approach |
|--------|---------|--------------|
| **Source Storage** | Separate WeakMap | Travels with image |
| **Restoration** | Complex snapshot system | Simple attribute reading |
| **Memory** | Stores full HTML snapshots | Just images + attributes |
| **Reliability** | Can lose content | Multiple fallbacks |

## Testing

### Testing Standards
Manual testing required - no formal testing framework established.

### Critical Test Cases

1. **Attribute Preservation Tests**
   - Render LaTeX: `$x^2 + y^2 = z^2$`
   - Inspect element to verify all attributes present
   - Reload page and verify attributes preserved
   - Auto-save triggered and attributes remain

2. **Source Extraction Tests**
   - Test extraction with all attributes present
   - Test with only alt attribute
   - Test with only title attribute
   - Test with no attributes (should return error message)

3. **Toggle Restoration Tests**
   - Toggle ON → render equations
   - Toggle OFF → verify source restored from attributes
   - Toggle ON again → verify re-renders correctly

4. **Copy/Paste Tests**
   - Copy rendered equation
   - Paste in new compose window
   - Verify alt text provides fallback
   - Extension recognizes and can re-render

5. **Backward Compatibility Tests**
   - Existing rendered equations without new attributes still work
   - Toggle operations function correctly
   - Send interceptor remains functional

### Expected Behaviors
- All rendered images have comprehensive self-documenting attributes
- Source extraction works with multiple fallback levels
- Restoration prioritizes attributes over WeakMap
- No regression in existing functionality
- Performance remains consistent
