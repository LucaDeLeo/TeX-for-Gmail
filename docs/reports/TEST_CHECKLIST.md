# TeX for Gmail - Manual Test Checklist

## Purpose
This document provides a comprehensive testing protocol for TeX for Gmail extension. All tests should be performed before releases and after significant changes.

## Test Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
- [ ] Chrome browser version 88 or higher
- [ ] Gmail account with new interface
- [ ] Internet connection for API calls
- [ ] Chrome DevTools familiarity
- [ ] Test content prepared (see below)

### Installation Verification
- [ ] Extension loads without errors in `chrome://extensions/`
- [ ] No console errors on Gmail load
- [ ] Content script injected (`TeXForGmail` object exists in console)

### Test Content
```latex
Basic inline: $E = mc^2$
Complex inline: $\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$
Display equation: $$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} dx = \sqrt{\pi}$$
Matrix: $$\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix}$$
Currency test: The price is $50 and $100
Code block test: <code>Use $x^2$ for superscript</code>
Multiple inline: $a^2$ and $b^2$ make $c^2$
```
