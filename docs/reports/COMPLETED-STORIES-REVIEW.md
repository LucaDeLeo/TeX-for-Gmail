# Completed Stories Review

Date: 2025-08-27
Reviewer: Bob (sm)

This review summarizes verification status, evidence, gaps, and next actions for all stories marked Done/Completed.

## Summary

- Completed: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 2.1, 2.2, 3.1, 3.2, 4.1
- Approved (awaiting full prod validation): 4.2
- Ready for Review: 4.3

Overall PRD Compliance from latest report: 65% (simulated env). Key blockers: external API timeouts, missing automatic server fallback during failures, display-math formatting edge cases, DPI defaults consistency.

## Story Reviews

### Story 1.1 — Core Extension Setup & Gmail Integration (Done)
- Evidence: `manifest.json` MV3; content script loads on Gmail; TeX button injected (`src/content.js`, `checkForComposeWindow`, `addTexButton`).
- Tests: `tests/test-gmail.html`, manual verification steps in story file.
- Gaps: None critical.

### Story 1.2 — LaTeX Detection and CodeCogs Rendering Pipeline (Done)
- Evidence: Pattern detection in `LATEX_PATTERNS`; URL generation via `getCodeCogsUrl`.
- Tests: `tests/test-inline-display.html`, `tests/test-codecogs-api.html`.
- Gaps: Inline vs display previously incorrect; now addressed in 3.1 acceptance; verify DPI defaults and prefix removal consistently applied.

### Story 1.3 — Toggle Control and User Interaction (Done)
- Evidence: Per-compose `toggleStates`, restore/render flows, cleanup and observer management.
- Tests: Multiple test harnesses plus visual QA checklists.
- Gaps: None blocking; restoration reliability improved in 2.x.

### Story 2.1 — Critical Bug Fixes (Done)
- Evidence: Cursor preservation via absolute offsets; removal observers; mutex patterns; cleanup in `performComprehensiveCleanup`.
- Tests: `tests/test-cursor.html`, `tests/test-gmail-simulation.html`.
- Gaps: None observed; continue to monitor in real Gmail.

### Story 2.2 — Self-Documenting LaTeX Images (Done)
- Evidence: `createMathWrapper` stores `alt`, `data-latex`, display type; click-to-edit handler restores source and cursor.
- Tests: `tests/test-story-2.2.html`, `tests/test-orphan-fix.html`.
- Gaps: None noted.

### Story 3.1 — Fix Core Rendering & Multi-Mode (Completed — Production Ready)
- Evidence: Corrected CodeCogs inline/display handling (no `\\inline`, `\\displaystyle` for display); Simple Math mode; server-health tracking.
- Tests: `tests/test-inline-display.html`, `tests/test-codecogs-api.html`, `docs/reports/qa-report-inline-display-issue.md`.
- Gaps: PRD notes missing automatic fallback during live API timeouts; add load timeouts and single-retry fallback to fully satisfy acceptance.

### Story 3.2 — Extended Patterns & Features (Done)
- Evidence: Support for `\\(...\\)`, `\\[...\\]`; abbreviation expansion; theorem wrappers; currency detection.
- Tests: `tests/test-pattern-debug.html`, `tests/test-story-3.2.html`.
- Gaps: Strengthen regression tests for overlapping patterns and stray delimiter artifacts.

### Story 4.1 — Options Page & Preferences (Done)
- Evidence: Options UI (`src/options.html/js`); DPI sliders; server selection; send behavior; checkboxes for visibility, shortcuts, Naive TeX, Simple Math.
- Tests: `tests/options-test.html`, visual proof pages.
- Gaps: DPI defaults in code vs UI must be aligned (raise inline to 200). Ensure `chrome.storage` persistence verified in real Gmail (test env blocks storage).

### Story 4.2 — Keyboard Shortcuts & Reading Mode (Approved)
- Evidence: Global handler in `content.js` for F8/F9, Cmd/Ctrl modifiers; read-mode overlay and toolbar button.
- Tests: `tests/test-story-4.2.html`, reading-mode verification.
- Gaps: Execute shortcuts in real Gmail to confirm no conflicts and ensure storage-driven enable/disable works.

### Story 4.3 — Feature Parity (Ready for Review)
- Evidence: Click-to-edit implemented; template shortcuts; settings toggles in options.
- Tests: `tests/test-story-4.3.html`.
- Gaps: Final integrated QA after implementing 3.1 fallback/timeout and DPI alignment.

## Cross-Cutting Gaps and Actions

1) Rendering Reliability
- Action: Add per-image load timeout (4–6s) and single-retry fallback (CodeCogs→WordPress) gated by `serverFallback` setting; degrade to Simple Math on dual failure.

2) DPI Compliance
- Action: Set defaults to Inline 200 / Display 300 across `content.js`, `options.js`, and `options.html`; verify runtime application and listener updates.

3) Display-Math Formatting
- Action: Guard against duplicate `$$` artifacts; ensure processed nodes and error wrappers are excluded from reprocessing; add regression test.

4) Persistence and Execution Context
- Action: Verify `chrome.storage` persistence in real Gmail; provide warning toast when storage is unavailable; smoke test shortcut execution in Gmail.

## Exit Criteria to Close Outstanding Items

- Fallback/timeout logic implemented and verified in tests; toasts shown on fallback/degrade; no thrashing.
- DPI defaults aligned and reflected in render URLs post-options change.
- Display-math tests pass with no stray delimiters; bracket variants verified.
- Shortcuts and send behavior confirmed working in real Gmail.
