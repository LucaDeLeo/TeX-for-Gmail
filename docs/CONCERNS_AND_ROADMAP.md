## Document Purpose
This document captures technical concerns, architectural limitations, and future improvement opportunities identified during comprehensive QA review and ultra-think analysis. It serves as a guide for future development priorities.

## üî¥ Critical Concerns

### 1. Privacy & Data Security
**Issue**: All LaTeX content is sent to external CodeCogs API  
**Impact**: HIGH - Confidential formulas, research, and proprietary algorithms exposed to third party  
**Current State**: No encryption, no user consent mechanism  
**Recommendation**: 
- Immediate: Add prominent privacy disclosure
- Long-term: Implement local rendering with KaTeX or MathJax
- Consider: Option for users to choose between local/remote rendering

### 2. External Dependency Risk
**Issue**: Complete dependency on CodeCogs API availability  
**Impact**: HIGH - Extension fails completely when:
- User is offline
- CodeCogs is down
- API rate limits exceeded (60/min)
- CodeCogs changes API format

**Recommendation**:
- Implement local rendering fallback
- Add retry logic with exponential backoff
- Cache rendered equations locally
- Monitor API health

---

## üü° Important Limitations

### 1. Dark Mode Incompatibility
**Issue**: LaTeX images have white backgrounds  
**Impact**: MEDIUM - Poor UX in Gmail dark mode  
**Current State**: White rectangles appear jarring in dark theme  
**Solutions**:
- Request transparent PNGs from CodeCogs (if supported)
- Detect dark mode and invert colors
- Use SVG output instead of PNG
- Local rendering with theme-aware colors

### 2. Copy/Paste Behavior
**Issue**: Users cannot copy LaTeX source from rendered equations  
**Impact**: MEDIUM - Workflow disruption for users sharing formulas  
**Solutions**:
- Add "Copy LaTeX" button on hover
- Store original LaTeX in clipboard API
- Implement right-click context menu

### 3. Performance at Scale
**Issue**: Untested with large numbers of equations  
**Impact**: MEDIUM - May cause lag in equation-heavy emails  
**Current Concerns**:
- Each equation = 1 API call (network latency)
- No lazy loading for off-screen equations
- No caching between sessions

**Solutions**:
- Implement IntersectionObserver for viewport rendering
- Add local storage cache with TTL
- Batch API requests where possible
- Progressive rendering for large documents

---

## üü† Technical Debt

### 1. Gmail DOM Brittleness
**Issue**: Relies on Gmail's internal DOM structure  
**Risk Areas**:
```javascript
// Fragile selectors that Gmail could change:
'.M9, .AD, .aoI'  // Compose windows
'.aZ .J-J5-Ji'    // Toolbar
'[g_editable="true"]'  // Compose area
```
**Mitigation**:
- Implement multiple fallback selectors
- Add DOM change detection and auto-recovery
- Consider using Gmail API instead

### 2. No Test Coverage
**Issue**: Zero automated tests  
**Impact**: Regression risk with each change  
**Needed Tests**:
- Unit tests for pattern matching
- Integration tests for DOM manipulation
- E2E tests with Playwright
- Performance benchmarks

### 3. Monolithic Architecture
**Issue**: All logic in single 1500+ line file  
**Problems**:
- Difficult to maintain
- Hard to test individual components
- No separation of concerns

**Refactoring Plan**:
```
src/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ core/
  ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pattern-matcher.js
  ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dom-manager.js
  ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ state-manager.js
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ rendering/
  ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ codecogs-renderer.js
  ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ local-renderer.js (future)
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ui/
  ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ toggle-button.js
  ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ toast-notifications.js
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ content.js (main entry)
```

## üìù Notes for Contributors

This extension has solid fundamentals but needs architectural improvements for long-term maintainability. The immediate priority should be implementing local rendering to address privacy concerns and enable offline support. 

The codebase would benefit from modularization and comprehensive testing before adding new features. Consider adopting a plugin architecture to allow community contributions without affecting core stability.
